### Requirements:
folium==0.14.0\
hdbscan==0.8.29\
numpy==1.21.5\
pandas==1.4.4\
utm==0.7.0\
The package requirements has been consolidated at model_1/requirements.txt.

### Demo:
A demo with 1000 trajectories has been saved in https://github.com/AgnesYe1029/FYP_trajectory_clustering/blob/141bb4df901f9879a0a0fbe663a95b92a1ee7e9d/model_1/Model%201%20Demo.pdf.
The original jupyter notebook with interactive map visualization is also provided as model_1/Model 1 Demo. This notebook experiments with 1000 trajectories, and produces cluster results. You can run it if necessary.\
