## Model 1: Trajectory Clustering with Polyline Reduction
### Requirements:

### Demo:
A demo with 1000 trajectories has been saved in https://github.com/AgnesYe1029/FYP_trajectory_clustering/blob/141bb4df901f9879a0a0fbe663a95b92a1ee7e9d/model_1/Model%201%20Demo.pdf.
The original jupyter notebook with interactive map visualization is also provided as model_1/Model 1 Demo. This notebook experiments with 1000 trajectories, and produces cluster results. You can run it if necessary.


## Model 2: Trajectory Clustering with Deep Learning
### Requirements:



## React.js Front-end Web application
### Requirements:

### To run:
1. cd to local directory.
2. cd frontend
3. run "npm start".
